# Fix Image Display Issue in Recent Uploads Modal

## Problem Description
Images are not visible in the "Recent Uploads" modal, but the functionality works when selecting them. Users can't see which image they're selecting.

## Root Causes and Solutions

### 1. Storage Bucket Policies (Most Likely Cause)
The `post-images` bucket might not have proper public access policies set up.

**Solution:**
Run the SQL commands in `post_images_storage_policy.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create a policy to allow public access to read files from post-images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public access to post images" ON storage.objects
    FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'post-images');
```

### 2. Image URL Format Issues
The image URLs might not be properly formatted or accessible.

**Solution:**
The code has been updated with:
- Better URL validation
- Loading states for images
- Error handling for failed image loads
- Debug logging to identify issues

### 3. CORS Issues
Cross-origin resource sharing might be blocking image access.

**Solution:**
- Added `crossOrigin="anonymous"` to image tags
- Updated fallback image URLs

## Changes Made

### RecentUploadsModal.jsx
1. **Added loading states**: Images now show a loading spinner while loading
2. **Improved error handling**: Better error states for failed image loads
3. **URL validation**: Added `getValidImageUrl()` function to validate and fix URLs
4. **Debug logging**: Added console logs to help identify issues
5. **Better fallback**: Improved placeholder images

### postsService.js
1. **Debug logging**: Added console logs to track image URL processing
2. **Better error handling**: Improved error reporting

## Testing Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**: Open browser developer tools and check for:
   - "Fetched recent images:" log to see what URLs are returned
   - "Processing image URL:" logs to see individual URLs
   - "Image loaded successfully:" or "Image failed to load:" logs

2. **Verify Storage Policies**: Ensure the `post-images` bucket has public read access

3. **Test Image URLs**: Try opening the image URLs directly in a new browser tab

4. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed image requests in the Network tab

## Additional Debugging

If images still don't display:

1. **Check the actual URLs** in the console logs
2. **Verify bucket exists** in Supabase Storage
3. **Test with a simple image** uploaded directly to the bucket
4. **Check if the bucket is public** in Supabase dashboard

## Quick Fix Commands

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if policies exist
SELECT * FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'post-images';

-- Create public read policy if it doesn't exist
CREATE POLICY "Public access to post images" ON storage.objects
    FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'post-images');
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- Images should display with a loading spinner initially
- Images should fade in once loaded
- Failed images should show an error state
- Console should show successful image loads
- Users should be able to see which image they're selecting
